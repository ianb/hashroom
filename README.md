# Hashroom

An experiment in sharing browsing activity

## To try it out

It's super experimental right now.  You can [download the XPI](https://ianb.github.io/hashroom/hashroom-0.0.1.xpi), make sure you change your `xpinstall.signatures.required` setting to false (and you must be using Firefox Nightly or Dev Edition), open the file and install it.
